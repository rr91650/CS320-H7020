  For my code to be functional and secure, I will ensure to test often and create test cases that test every aspect of code.  I will make sure that there are also tests that could possibly defy the requirements the user is seeking within their program.  All test coverage within J-Unit tests have to be at least 80% effective to be moved on to the next step in the development process.  Identifying user requirements are one of the most important if not the most important part of the software development process.  Looking at the key details on what to do and what NOT to do is important, and identifying what not to do in the program is key for a software development team to reach success within the program.  What is a software development process without the user requirements?  To approach designing software, it is important to develop test procedures, key objectives, identify what software model to incoporate, and plan the testing process.  It is also important to see whether the team and I want to decide on a waterfall model or an agile model.  Nowadays, an agile model is efficient for most cases since testing early and often is highly effective.  I hope to continue to build on my skills, specifically J-Unit testing skills, that I have acquired within this course.
